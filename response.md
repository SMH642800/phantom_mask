  - Implemented at `GET /search?query_name=...&search_type=pharmacy|mask`
  
- [x] Process a user purchases a mask from a pharmacy, and handle all relevant data changes in an atomic transaction.  
  - Implemented at `POST /purchase`


### A.2. API Document

I used **FastAPI** to implement the server, and it provides interactive API documentation automatically.

You need to run server first by following scripts:
```bash
PYTHONPATH=. python app/main.py
```

Then you can test and view all endpoints through Swagger UI at:

ðŸ‘‰ `http://localhost:8000/docs`

This includes route parameters, input/output formats, and sample responses.

> You can also directly use [this](./document/openapi-resolved.yaml) to get the complete OpenAPI specification file.
> 
> - Usable with Postman, Swagger Editor, or any tool that supports OpenAPI 3.0.
> - Simply drag and drop or import `document/openapi-resolved.yaml` to browse all API structure, parameters, response formats, and examples.


### A.3. Import Data Commands
To load the raw data into the database, run the following scripts:

```bash
# Step 1: Initialize database schema
PYTHONPATH=. python app/init_db.py

# Step 2: Run the ETL process (transform & load data)
PYTHONPATH=. python app/etl.py
```

### B.1. Test Coverage Report

I wrote 20+ unit tests using `pytest` and FastAPIâ€™s `TestClient` to verify core functionalities.

The tests cover:
- âœ… Root endpoint
- âœ… Pharmacies: open time filter, mask listing, and price filters
- âœ… Users: top users by transaction
- âœ… Summary: total mask sold and value
- âœ… Search: relevance-based pharmacy/mask lookup
- âœ… Purchase: valid + error flows
- âœ… Input validation and exception handling

Please check the test coverage report at below.

You can run the test script by using the command below:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=. pytest --cov=app --cov-report=term-missing --cov-config=.coveragerc
```


### B.2. Dockerized

I have fully Dockerized the FastAPI application using a `Dockerfile` based on Python 3.12.

Please check my Dockerfile at [here](./Dockerfile).

On the local machine, please follow the commands below to build it.
```bash
docker build -t phantom-mask-api .
```

Run the app in a container:
```bash
docker run -p 8000:8000 phantom-mask-api
```

Then access the API at:
ðŸ‘‰ `http://localhost:8000/docs`
