## A. Required Information
### A.1. Requirement Completion Rate

- <!-- Feature requirements and corresponding API paths for easy review and tracking -->
- [x] List all pharmacies open at a specific time and on a day of the week if requested.  
  - Implemented at `GET /pharmacies/open`  <!-- Query pharmacies open at a specific time -->
  
- [x] List all masks sold by a given pharmacy, sorted by mask name or price.  
  - Implemented at `GET /pharmacies/{name}/masks`  <!-- Query masks sold by a given pharmacy -->
  
- [x] List all pharmacies with more or less than x mask products within a price range.  
  - Implemented at `GET /pharmacies/filter_by_mask_count`  <!-- Filter pharmacies by specific mask count condition within a price range -->
  
- [x] The top x users by total transaction amount of masks within a date range.  
  - Implemented at `GET /users/top`  <!-- Query top users by transaction amount in a date range -->
  
- [x] The total number of masks and dollar value of transactions within a date range.  
  - Implemented at `GET /summary`  <!-- Query total transactions and value in a date range -->
  
- [x] Search for pharmacies or masks by name, ranked by relevance to the search term.  
  - Implemented at `GET /search?query_name=...&search_type=pharmacy|mask`  <!-- Keyword search for pharmacies or masks -->
  
- [x] Process a user purchases a mask from a pharmacy, and handle all relevant data changes in an atomic transaction.  
  - Implemented at `POST /purchase`  <!-- Handle purchase process and data consistency -->



### A.2. API Document

<!-- API documentation section, including interactive Swagger UI and OpenAPI yaml import instructions -->
I used **FastAPI** to implement the server, and it provides interactive API documentation automatically.

You need to run server first by following scripts:
```bash
PYTHONPATH=. python app/main.py
```

Then you can test and view all endpoints through Swagger UI at:

ðŸ‘‰ `http://localhost:8000/docs`

This includes route parameters, input/output formats, and sample responses.

> You can also directly use [this](./document/openapi-resolved.yaml) to get the complete OpenAPI specification file.
> 
> - Usable with Postman, Swagger Editor, or any tool that supports OpenAPI 3.0.
> - Simply drag and drop or import `document/openapi-resolved.yaml` to browse all API structure, parameters, response formats, and examples.
> <!-- All API input/output formats and examples can be interactively viewed in Swagger UI, or by importing the yaml into Postman/Swagger Editor. -->


### A.3. Import Data Commands
To load the raw data into the database, run the following scripts:

```bash
# Step 1: Initialize database schema
PYTHONPATH=. python app/init_db.py

# Step 2: Run the ETL process (transform & load data)
PYTHONPATH=. python app/etl.py
```


## B. Bonus Information
### B.1. Test Coverage Report

I wrote 20+ unit tests using `pytest` and FastAPIâ€™s `TestClient` to verify core functionalities.

The tests cover:
- âœ… Root endpoint
- âœ… Pharmacies: open time filter, mask listing, and price filters
- âœ… Users: top users by transaction
- âœ… Summary: total mask sold and value
- âœ… Search: relevance-based pharmacy/mask lookup
- âœ… Purchase: valid + error flows
- âœ… Input validation and exception handling

Please check the test coverage report at below.
```bash

You can run the test script by using the command below:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=. pytest --cov=app --cov-report=term-missing --cov-config=.coveragerc
```


### B.2. Dockerized

I have fully Dockerized the FastAPI application using a `Dockerfile` based on Python 3.12.

Please check my Dockerfile at [here](./Dockerfile).

On the local machine, please follow the commands below to build it.
```bash
docker build -t phantom-mask-api .
```

Run the app in a container:
```bash
docker run -p 8000:8000 phantom-mask-api
```

Then access the API at:

ðŸ‘‰ `http://localhost:8000/docs`
